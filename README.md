Java RMI over P2P networks

An attempt to distribute all Java RMI services in P2P networks to allow highly distributed applications. 

This is a research project and it is documented in the paper [P2P-RMI: Transparent Distribution of Remote Java Objects](http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:352-207137).

The distributed Codebase part has been developed as part of a student graduation project. This project duplicates some code and requires other code from the UCE_Deprecated repository. It should be refactored and  updated to work with UCE or SIPUCE but there are currently no plans to do that.

It is released here in the hope that some might find it useful under the terms and conditions of the GPL v3, see LICENSE.
